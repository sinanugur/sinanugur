### Hello there ðŸ‘‹

I am a researcher at Department of Pathology, Institute of Clinical Medicine, University of Oslo, Norway.

- ðŸ”­ My research interests include spatial transcriptomics, RNA sequencing, early detection of cancer and RNA-RNA interactions. 

- ðŸŒ± I did my PhD (Biotechnology/Bioinformatics) at University of Canterbury, New Zealand. I was working on non-coding RNA interactions in prokaryotes. My PhD thesis focused on ncRNA-mRNA interactions in prokaryotic genomes (bacteria and archaea).
